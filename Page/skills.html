      As a software engineering student at IJSE, I have developed a strong
      proficiency in Java, MySQL, and HTML. My experience with Java includes
      building robust applications, while my knowledge of MySQL allows me to
      efficiently manage and query databases. Additionally, I have honed my
      skills in HTML to create well-structured and visually appealing web pages.
      I am continuously expanding my expertise to stay current with the latest
      technologies and best practices.
